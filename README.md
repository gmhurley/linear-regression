# linear-regression

## Deliverables

A Git repo called linear-regression containing at least:
a requirements.txt file
simple-linear-regression.ipynb
supporting data files

## Normal Mode

Go through the simple-linear-regression.ipynb file included with this repository and add cells to address the prompts, exploring the data through the use of pandas and scikit-learn.

Your final submission should be a well-organized IPython notebook file with charts and data exploring linear relationships in the data.

## Hard Mode

Find another source of data that you suspect may have a single- or multiple-linear relationship, attempt to find a best fit model for the data, and report your findings, showing chart(s) as necessary
